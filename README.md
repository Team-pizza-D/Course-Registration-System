# Course-Registration-System

## Project Overview
The ECE Department Course Registration System is a software solution designed to streamline  the course registration process for students within the ECE department.

This project contains 3 parts, which are :

1. **DataBase**
2. **Classes**
3. **The GUI**

Each part is created in a separate Python file and connected through the main file (`main.py`).
