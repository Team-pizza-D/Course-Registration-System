# Course-Registration-System

## Project Overview
The ECE Department Course Registration System is a software solution designed to streamline  the course registration process for students within the ECE department.

This project contains 3 parts, which are :

1. **DataBase**
2. **Classes**
3. **The GUI**

Each part is created in a separate Python file and connected through the main file (`main.py`).

## How to Run the Program
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your computer.  
2. Place all project files in the same folder:
```css
main.py
classes.py
GUI.py
users.py
programs.py
README.md
```
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.  
4. Run the program by typing:
```bash
python main.py()
```
Follow the on-screen menu enter University ID and password then press Login.

## Challenges Faced

### DataBase

Learn everything from the beginning 
Understand what is the DataBase and how to creat it
Learn how to create multiple table and columns
Learn how to insert data in the tables
Learn how to connect the tables with the Classes and manage it

### Classes

Understand what is the Classes and how to creat it

### The GUI

Understand what is the GUI and how to creat it




Learn new things such as bitwise 

Handling diffrent conversion formulas

Managing input validation to prevent crashes from invalid user input.

Linking multiple modules together while maintaining clean and readable code.

Handling user navigation between modes efficiently.

Testing edge cases such as division by zero and invalid units.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates teamwork, modular programming, and data validation in Python.
Each part was developed by two team members to ensure the quality of the work.
The result is a user-friendly Course-Registration-System that is organized, functional, and easy to extend in the future.
This project has improved our teamwork skills.
